# Experimenting with “Deep Learning for Case-Based Reasoning through Prototypes: A Neural Network that Explains Its Predictions”
Marius Arvinte, Mai Lee Chang, (Ethan) Yuqian Heng

Modifications of the code from https://github.com/OscarcarLi/PrototypeDL. Tensorflow implementation. Python 3.x required.

Folder structure:
- "main" - Contains individual .py scripts for each dataset. Can be directly run. NN parameters and number of prototypes are editable in the first few lines.

- "results" - Presaved, extended simulation results for each dataset. .xls files contain weight matrices of the last dense layer. The "img" folder in each case contains images of the autoencoder performance and the decoded prototype vectors.
